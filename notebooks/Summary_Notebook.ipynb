    "We can see that both internal and external features play a part in predicting the price of a rental property. with the most important internal being: the number of bathrooms, the number of bedrooms and whether or not the rental property is furnished. In contrast, external features that matter the most for rental price are: proximity to shopping centre, schools and recreational centres. This is quite suprising as shopping centres and schools seem to be vastly more important than the distance to the CBD, which is somewhat unexpected. Similarly, other additional features such as air-conditioning, dishwashers and heaters were not among the top 10 most important features contributing to the price prediction. It was thought that such features, would be much higher priority."
